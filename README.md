# Yoga-Instructor
# Introduction
A virtual yoga instructor uses PoseNet which is a machine learning model that allows
for Real-time Human Pose Estimation and overlay a skeleton stick figure on top. Pose
estimation refers to computer vision techniques that detect human figures in images and
videos so that one could determine, for example, where someone’s elbow shows up in
an image. To be clear, this technology is not recognizing who is in an image — there is
no personally identifiable information associated to pose detection. The algorithm is
simply estimating where key body joints are. PoseNet main objective is to inspire more
developers and makers to experiment and apply pose detection to their own unique
projects.
# Motivation
The body is the most complex biochemical factory we know of & learning how to
engineer it allows us to enter sense modalities at will. We are all caught up in the rat
race. Our mind, soul, and body need to experience a deep fulfilling joy free from all the
worldly tensions. The first solution that pops up is YOGA. yoga is associated with the
culture and heritage of India. In Sanskrit, yoga means to unite and describes a way to
live a healthy life. This may be a difficult practice not necessarily fun but the benefits
from it are worth it. Our project is to motivate society to practice yoga by conceiving,
designing, and building the prototype for a yoga instructor.
# Definition
Human pose estimation is an important problem in the field of Computer Vision. Imagine
being able to track a person’s every small movement and do a biomechanical analysis
in real-time. The technology will have huge implications. Applications may including
video surveillance, assisted living, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and
sports analysis.
# Project Objectives
Yoga has an ancient tradition of physical and mental training to improve well-being.
Modern Hatha Yoga, which emphasizes physical conditioning and mental strength
through training physical postures, has been growing in popularity over the last couple
decades.
However, the time and cost of getting to a yoga studio can be prohibitive. Still others
would prefer to practice outside of the group setting.
Here, we explore the development of YogAI. With pose recognition, we implement a
smart assistant to provide corrective advice to guide practitioners.
The goal is to help a user reduce stress, anxiety, and depression through a series of
guide meditative poses.
